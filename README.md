## Problem Statements
p1.py  For a given natural number `n` find the largest natural number written with the same digits. (e.g. `n=3658, m=8653`).
p2.py The numbers `n1` and `n2` have the property `P` if their writing in base 10 uses the same digits (e.g. `2113 and 323121`). Determine whether two given natural numbers have property `P`.
p3.py Generate the largest perfect number smaller than a given natural number `n`. If such a number does not exist, a message should be displayed. A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors, except itself. (e.g.  `6 is a perfect number, as 6=1+2+3`).
