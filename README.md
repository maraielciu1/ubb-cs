## Requirements
Implement a menu-driven console application to help visualize the way sorting algorithms work. You will be given two of the algorithms from the list below to implement (one from each set). When started, the program will print a menu with the following options:
- Generate a list of `n` random natural numbers. Generated numbers must be between `0` and `100`.
- Sort the list using bubble sort.
- Sort the list using comb sort.
- Exit the program


## Implementation requirements
- Write a function for each sorting algorithm; each function should take as parameter the list to be sorted and the value of parameter `step` that was read from the console.
- Functions communicate using input parameter(s) and return values (**DO NOT use global, or module-level variables**)
- Provide the user with a menu-driven console-based user interface. Input data should be read from the console and the results printed to the console. At each step, the program must provide the user the context of the operation (never display an empty prompt).
