Use of Tools
 - Flex — defines the lexical structure of the language using regular expressions and automatically generates the C source code (lex.yy.c) for the lexer.
 - GCC / Clang — compiles the generated C files (lex.yy.c, symbol_table.c) into an executable program.
 - C Language — used for implementing data structures (symbol table), handling file outputs (PIF, ST, Errors), and integrating with the Flex scanner.

Lexical Tokens Detection
The lexer identifies tokens according to the DSL grammar:
 - Identifiers — start with ! followed by a letter, then letters, digits, or underscores (![A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*).
Example: !x, !value1.
 - Constants
        - Integer: (0|[+\-]?[1-9][0-9]*)
        - Float: [+\-]?[0-9]+\.[0-9]+
        - Character: '[A-Za-z0-9_]'
        - String: "([A-Za-z0-9_ \.;!])*".
Keywords — reserved words like START, STOP, IF, ELSE, READ, WRITE, etc.
Operators and Separators — + - * / % = == != < > <= >= && || ( ) { } ; , ..
Others — any unrecognized symbol produces a lexical error message recorded with line and column.
Each recognized token is written into the Program Internal Form (PIF) as (token_name, ST_position).

Symbol Table (ST) Management
 - Implemented in C as a hash table with double hashing to resolve collisions efficiently.
 - Stores only identifiers and constants.
 - Each symbol receives a unique index when first inserted.
 - Main Operations:
        - st_init() — initialize the table.
        - st_insert(value) — add a new symbol if not already present.
        - st_search(value) — check existence of a symbol.
        - st_get_index(value) — return the stored index.
        - st_print(filename) — export all entries to a text file.
 - The Symbol Table ensures fast lookups and no duplicates, supporting later compiler phases.
