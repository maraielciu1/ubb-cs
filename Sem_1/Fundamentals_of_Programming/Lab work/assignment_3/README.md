# :computer: Algorithm Complexity

## Requirements
- Calculate the complexity of the sorting algorithms you've implemented for the previous assignment(sorting).  **best case** as well as **worst case**. You can show this on screen or written on paper.
- Update the program created for the previous assignment by adding the following three additional menu entries -- one for ***best case***, one for ***average case*** and the last one for ***worst case***. When the user selects one of these, the program will time and illustrate the runtime of the implemented algorithms by sorting 5 data structures, each having twice the number of elements of the previous one. The elements of the data structure must be in accordance with the current case.
